# Vehicle Spawner for FiveM

![](preview.png)

A vehicle spawner using ox_lib and ESX.

Note: ESX is only used for the vehicle related functions, because I didn't want to create any server-side code. If you don't like it just adapt to your own requirements, as you should.

The display names for the vehicle list are in Portuguese as `parser.lua` is also coded to parse the vehicles with a portuguese display name. Use this file to parse the list to your language.

I parsed `vehicles.json` from [Durty Free's Vehicle Data Dump](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurtyFree/gta-v-data-dumps/master/vehicles.json)
